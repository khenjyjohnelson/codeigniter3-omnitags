# Omnitags

This repository is where I experiment with Omnitags and its implementation. The primary goal of this project is to streamline framework usage, making it easier to deploy and manage multiple projects without the repetitive process of copying and pasting. With Omnitags, I aim to improve the efficiency of project distribution through branches, enabling quicker and more dynamic framework integration across different applications.

## Purpose

Omnitags simplifies the setup and deployment of various projects by utilizing a branch-based implementation rather than manual duplication, saving both time and effort. Itâ€™s designed to scale seamlessly across different web projects, making framework management more efficient and flexible.

## Past Projects Built Using Omnitags

Here are some of the projects that showcase the capabilities of Omnitags:

### 1. [Hotel Hebat](http://hotelkhenjy.com) (Hotel Management Website)
**Description**: Hotel Hebat is a comprehensive hotel management system built to handle room bookings, transactions, guest management, and hotel operations. This project showcases Omnitags' ability to manage complex, feature-rich applications with a focus on usability, scalability, and a responsive UI. The hotel management system supports multi-user functionality, transaction histories, and content management features.

### 2. [RecycleAware](http://hotelkhenjy.com/recycleaware) (Recycling Awareness Website)
**Description**: RecycleAware is a website aimed at raising awareness about plastic recycling. Built with Omnitags, this project demonstrates how a flexible framework can be used to create community-driven platforms. It includes features for sharing recycling tips, showcasing recycled products, and engaging users in environmental discussions.

### 3. [Levato](http://hotelkhenjy.com/levato) (UMKM Inquiry Website)
**Description**: Levato is designed as an inquiry system for UMKMs (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises), providing a platform for businesses to register inquiries and communicate with potential partners or clients. Using Omnitags, Levato was developed quickly and efficiently, allowing for smooth scalability and management of user inquiries and business listings.

### 4. [BarangMaster](http://hotelkhenjy.com/inventory) (Inventory Website Built and Hosted in Under 1 Hour)
**Description**: BarangMaster showcases the speed and flexibility of Omnitags by enabling the creation and deployment of a fully functional inventory management system in less than one hour. The project includes basic inventory tracking, stock management, and reporting features, demonstrating how Omnitags can be used for rapid prototyping and deployment of critical business tools.

### 5. [BNSP](http://hotelkhenjy.com/bnsp) (Medical Website in Preparation for Career Enrichment Test)
**Description**: BNSP is a medical inventory website. I designed it to prepare for my career enrichment tests. Built using Omnitags, this website provides essential information, resources, and tools to assist users in managing medical items.

### 6. [Uvers Website](http://hotelkhenjy.com/uvers_tpl) (Experimental College Website)
**Description**: Uvers Website is an experimental platform aimed at replicating a college website experience. Built using Omnitags, the site offers a dynamic environment for experimenting with different educational features, content structures, and layout designs that are common in academic institutions.


## How Omnitags Works

Omnitags relies on a branch-based approach to project management, allowing for different modules and applications to exist within the same repository. This means that instead of starting from scratch or copying existing codebases, users can simply switch between branches to implement or modify the framework for various projects. This approach saves development time and ensures consistency across applications.



# CodeIgniter 3 Project Setup

This document will guide you through setting up an old CodeIgniter 3 project using either Laragon or XAMPP. Please ensure that you are using a PHP version below PHP 8, as this project may not be compatible with newer PHP versions.

## Prerequisites

- PHP version: Below 8.0
- Laragon or XAMPP installed on your machine
- Access to the SQL file for database setup

## Setting Up the Project

### 1. Clone or Download the Project

First, clone or download the CodeIgniter 3 project files to your local machine.

### 2. Move Project Files

#### For Laragon:

- Move the project folder to the `C:\laragon\www\` directory.
- The folder structure should look like this:
